# Extraction library

pcb-flow's own datasheet extractions, one file per LCSC part: `<LCSC>.json`, in the
same schema as a board's `parts/<lcsc>.json` (`datasheet_extract.py`,
`DATASHEET_SCHEMA`).

`check_ratings` uses the board's own `parts/<lcsc>.json` when it has one.
Otherwise it falls back to the entry here, so a common part is judged on
every board that places it instead of being reported `rating_unrated`. The
board's own extraction always wins, because it may describe a later revision.

## Rules for an entry

Fact, not fiction: every number comes from the datasheet the part's maker
publishes for that exact LCSC code. A distributor listing, another vendor's
datasheet for the same MPN, or memory does not count.

- `lcsc` is the file's name. `pinout[].pin` is the pad number the KiCad
  footprint uses, and `name` is the datasheet's pin name.
- Every pin that is connected and is not ground or nc needs at least one
  `pin_ratings` row of `kind: "voltage"`. The exception is a pin used only as
  the `ref` of another row (an emitter, a source, an anode).
- Every row's `source` cites the document, its revision, `p.N` and the table,
  and quotes the line: `"JSCJ S8050 SOT-23 datasheet Rev 2.0 p.1 Maximum
  Ratings: 'VCEO Collector-Emitter Voltage 25 V'"`.
- `source_pdf` gives the maker, title, revision, page count, the page of the
  pin map, the URL, and `sha256 <hex>` of the copy that was read.
- Bounds relative to another pin use `ref`: a BJT's VCEO is `max` on C with
  `ref: "E"`, and a P-FET's VDS is `min` on D with `ref: "S"`.
- If a pin has no rating in the PDF, leave it unrated: it is better reported
  as unrated than given a number nobody read. Connectors and switches use
  the contact rating printed for every contact.

PDFs are not committed (copyright). The URL and sha256 let anyone fetch the
same copy and re-check it.
`tests/test_check_ratings.py::test_library_entry_is_valid_and_cites_its_datasheet`
checks every entry for schema, LCSC, URL, sha256 and page citations.
