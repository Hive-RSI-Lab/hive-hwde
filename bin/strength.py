"""hwde's planted faults: the share its own gates and checks still catch.

    python bin/strength.py        (the venv's python; bin/score.py calls it)

The score (bin/score.py) charges what hwde's gates find on pinned boards.
A check made looser finds less, so on its own that number could rise by
loosening hwde's checks. This is the other half: faults planted where each
gate's verdict comes from, run through the same code the gates run, offline
and in seconds. Each fault that gets through charges CRASH, as a gate that
can't run does: a check that misses a fault it was built to catch isn't
measuring the boards, so loosening one costs more than the findings it
could hide (docs/score.md, "The planted faults").

  gate    reference/gates.yaml through gate.evaluate: each of the gates the
          boards pass fails a report carrying one real finding of each
          kind it fails on. FAILS_ON pins those severities. Each finding is
          one a real run wrote, put among the findings of a report a real
          run wrote: erc and drc_routed's are KiCad's own, kept in
          tests/golden/gates/; verify's and dfm's are what their checks
          raise on the verify and dfm legs' planted faults, as they raise
          them now. Nothing in them says they were planted, so gate.py
          can't let them through without letting the same finding through
          on a board.
  verify  tests/golden's mutants, through tests/golden's scorecard
          (score_checks: each mutant run through the one check that owns
          it). Every check in the verify suite (verify_all.load_checks)
          must own at least one mutant, and a mutant whose check left the
          suite is a miss, so taking a check or its fault out costs too.
  dfm     the bench's P9 fixtures with a known answer (tests/fixtures/
          stages), and faults planted at JLC's published floors in a copy
          of pd-trigger's shipped drill file (DRILL_FAULTS): a hole closer
          to its neighbour than 0.5 mm, a drill under 0.3 mm. A floor in
          jlc_capabilities.yaml lowered past them lets the fault through.

ERC and DRC themselves are KiCad's; their planted faults would need
kicad-cli and are not here (the gate leg still holds what hwde decides
about their reports).

faults() gives (gate step, fault, caught) for each; run alone it prints one
line per fault and exits 1 when one got through.
