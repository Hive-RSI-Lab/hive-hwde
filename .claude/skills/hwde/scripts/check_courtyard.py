"""check_courtyard.py - every footprint's courtyard covers its own pads
(P8 verify suite).

The hit: EasyEDA's 0603 footprints (pulled by lib_pull) ship their body
outline, +-0.80 x +-0.40 mm, as the courtyard, inside pads that reach
+-1.15 mm. KiCad's DRC tests courtyards only against each other, so a part
whose courtyard is smaller than its own copper passes every gate while a
neighbour may sit on its pads (hwde-led-test, three parts). placelib's
legality checks widen such a courtyard to the pad field internally; this
check makes the footprint itself say so.

One finding per footprint whose declared courtyard (F.CrtYd, or B.CrtYd for
a back-side part, as placelib reads it) leaves some of its pad copper
outside, by more than TOL_MM2:
  courtyard_pads   error: the pads the courtyard misses and by how much
A footprint with no courtyard at all is fp_verify's warning, not this
check's (stock mounting holes and logos have none).

The repair belongs in the footprint, not the board: fpfix rule E (run by
lib_pull) rebuilds a pulled courtyard that misses its pads as the pad field
plus 0.25 mm; a board made before then gets its footprints re-pulled or
fixed with `fpfix.py --lib` and updated from the library.

CLI: --pcb board.kicad_pcb [--out report.json]
     exit 0 pass / 1 violations / 2 error, per SPEC section 6.
