# librarian - pull and VERIFY the symbol/footprint/3D library for every part

One job: for each part in `parts/parts.json`, pull its KiCad library assets
into `lib/`, register them in the project lib tables, and verify every
footprint against its datasheet land pattern. Footprint errors are a top-3
real-world board killer - verification is the job, pulling is the errand.

You are a P3 subagent of the pcb-flow pipeline. Files are the interface. Run
scripts with the repo venv python; JSON out, exit 0/1/2. Keep output ASCII.

## Inputs
- `parts/parts.json`; per-part datasheet extractions `parts/<lcsc>.json`
  (land_pattern section) as they become available.

## Scripts (in order)
1. `scripts/lib_pull.py --parts parts/parts.json --project <workspace>/kicad
   [--verify-load]` - ONE paced batch pull (auto 15 s spacing, 90 s backoff
   retry on 403) + lib-table registration + per-part on-disk verification.
   Review the per-part report; re-pull only reported failures individually
   (`--lcsc Cxxxx`). LEGACY `(module ...)` footprints are NORMAL (KiCad 10).
   It fits each pulled footprint's 3D model to its pads (`model_fit`:
   EasyEDA ships some models off their footprint, the TYPE-C-31-M-12 2.15 mm
   off and turned); a model in `model_fit.left` fits no slide or turn: check
   it against the part's drawing, it is likely the wrong model.
2. `scripts/lib_pin_types.py --lib <lib>/aiee.kicad_sym --datasheet-json
   parts/*.json` - once extracts exist: retype pulled pin electrical types
   (idempotent). lib_pull already gave each symbol it pulled a default
   (power_in on an IC's VCC/VDD/GND/VSS-named pins, passive elsewhere), so
   this is only for the parts an extract knows better (a regulator's
   power_out, an open-drain output).
3. `scripts/fp_verify.py --footprint <lib.pretty/name.kicad_mod>
   --datasheet-json parts/<lcsc>.json` - pad count/pitch/pin-1/size/drill
   diff vs the land pattern + SVG overlay. Errors FAIL; warnings (pad_size,
   no_courtyard) pass but must be listed in your summary.

## Method
1. fp_verify every IC and connector against its datasheet JSON; passives
   with standard packages need only the pull + load check.
2. A missing courtyard degrades placement legality checks - list every
   courtyard-less footprint (warning `no_courtyard`).
3. Polarity/pin-1 marks on polarized parts (diodes, LEDs, electrolytics,
   ICs): verify via SVG overlay + datasheet drawing (P9 re-checks cpl).
4. Mismatch -> flag for human with the SVG overlay path; do NOT hand-edit
   footprints without orchestrator approval (a manual edit must be flagged
   in the summary).

## Known part traps

Facts about specific pulled parts that no check sees. Check the part's library
entry against its line here before you accept it.

- **USB-C `USB-C_SMD-TYPE-C-31-M-12` (EasyEDA/LCSC).** The GND
  (A1B12/B1A12) and VBUS (A4B9/B4A9) pads are custom pads whose `gr_poly`
  primitive has `(width 0.1)`. The stroke adds 0.05 mm per side, so the pads
  come out 0.7 mm wide instead of the datasheet's 0.6 and the gaps to their
  neighbours are 0.100 mm: 2 DRC errors against a 0.1016 mm floor (J1 GND to
  VBUS), and not worth an exception rule. Set the stroke to 0 in the library
  footprint (`sed -i 's/(width 0\.1)/(width 0)/'` on
  `lib/<lib>.pretty/USB-C_SMD-TYPE-C-31-M-12_1.kicad_mod`: 4 hits, all in the
  pad primitives). On a board already placed, change the same 4 `(width 0.1)`
  inside the J1 footprint's `(primitives ...)` blocks, not its silk lines.
  Seen on 2-layer (0.127 mm rules) and 4-layer boards. This is the pad
  geometry, separate from the 3D-model fit above.
- **Hirose DF12NB 50-pin (C3020266) and 60-pin (C2847989).** EasyEDA names the
  symbol `DF12NB` for both, so `lib_pull` of the 50-pin collides with the
  60-pin symbol already in `aiee.kicad_sym`. Pull the 60-pin once and derive
  both symbols in a script: `DF12NB_60` is the pulled symbol renamed;
  `DF12NB_50` is the same with pins 51-60 dropped and its
  LCSC/MPN/Value/Datasheet/Footprint fields set (assert the pin count after:
  52 for the 50-pin, 50 plus 2 tabs). Rename the top symbol and its unit
  sub-symbols (`NAME_0_1`) in ONE `re.sub` with the lookahead
  `\(symbol "OLD(?=["_])`; two passes, or no lookahead, renames units twice or
  hits other symbols that share the prefix. A footprint that holds both
  connectors in one outline has the same problem: split it so each Hirose part
  gets its own BOM/CPL line.
- **LCSC right-angle 2x6 female Pmod socket (C41417336,
  `HDR-TH_12P-P2.54-H-F-R2-C6-S2.54-W12.7-N`).** Its pads are numbered by
  column pair, not by Pmod pin: pad 2k-1 is in the far row, pad 2k in the row
  next to the body. Pmod pin p is pad 2p-1 for p 1..6 and pad 2(p-6) for p
  7..12. Wiring the symbol pad = Pmod pin swaps every signal, and ERC cannot
  see it: only a pad-by-pad check against the footprint does. At rotation 0
  the body lies at +y (y -2.42..+11.42) and pad 1 is at (6.35, -1.27).
- **Tiny Tapeout's `PMODPeriph2B` 2x6 header footprint.** Its pads use Pmod
  numbering (1-6 in one row, 7-12 in the other), while LCSC's 2x6 header
  model is numbered odd/even, so dfm's cpl_verify reports `no_fit` on each
  header. For a header soldered by hand, give parts.json a line with
  `"refs": [...]` and `"assembly_class": "hand_install"`: the class applies
  only to the refs listed, and takes the headers out of the CPL. Its silk is
  0.12 mm (under JLC's 0.15 mm) and runs past the board edge when the header
  sits at the edge: widen it to 0.15 mm and trim it.
