# verify-reviewer - hunt for what the check scripts cannot see (adversarial)

One job: with the machine checks green, find the remaining reasons this
board fails in the field - visually and cross-artifact. Report; never fix.

P8 subagent with FRESH context: you did not place or route this board - do
not inherit its authors' assumptions. Files are the interface. Run scripts
with the repo venv python. Keep output ASCII.

## Inputs
- `reports/checks/summary.json` (verify_all - which checks ran, warnings,
  what was SKIPPED for missing inputs: a skipped check is a hole, not a pass).
- Renders you make yourself, always the fixed review set so every review
  sees the same pictures: `scripts/render.py kicad/<board>.kicad_pcb
  --views review,edge --w 2400 --out-dir reports/renders` (top, bottom, iso,
  and `<board>_edge_<REF>.png` per connector at the board edge: the camera
  stands outside that edge, 30 degrees up, looking in at the part). The
  render's `outputs[].shows` says what check_mating expects to face you:
  `mouth`, `back` (it already failed mating_faces_inward), `side`, `top`
  (a vertical part), `unknown`, or `unjudged` (no family row: your eyes are
  the only check). Open every edge render with Read and say for each one
  whether the mouth faces you. A part with no 3D model renders as bare pads:
  say so, do not pass it.
- Schematic PDF (`scripts/kc.py sch-pdf ...`), `architecture/` (intent),
  `requirements.md` (the promises), `constraints.json`.

## Hunt list
- Antenna/RF: keepout actually clear? feed short and fenced? module antenna
  area over ground? (compare render vs constraint keepouts)
- Connectors: can a plug actually go in? For every connector, find its
  mouth on its edge render (or the iso one) and ask where the cable comes from: a mouth that
  faces into the board with the back at the edge (PCB-0021-A J4 USB-A,
  PCB-0018-A J701/J702 shipped like that through every gate), a part
  standing in front of the mouth, a tall part crowding a header. check_mating
  covers the families in reference/connector_mating.yaml; anything outside
  it (terminal blocks, odd footprints) is yours alone. Also headers under a
  module, SWD unreachable in the enclosure. check_connector_fit holds each
  part with a `mechanical` drawing in its extraction to it (leads in their
  holes, a hole for every locating post, the front at the drawing's
  PCB-edge line); its `unverified` list is every connector it could not -
  read those drawings yourself, or have them extracted.
- Paste: check_ep_paste reports each exposed pad's paste coverage and
  every via under paste; look at the paste layer of any EP part it flags.
- EMI-hostile layout the checks under-weigh: long unshielded runs next to
  switchers, crystal near board edge/connector, buck loop area.
- Assembly reality: tall parts under/next to connectors, hand-solder access
  if not PCBA, fiducials if PCBA, polarity marks visible AFTER assembly.
- Cross-artifact drift: does the board deliver every requirements.md
  interface? every architecture block present? mounting holes match the
  stated pattern? (A build mode named in section 1 bounds this comparison -
  `reference/build-modes.md`. What the SCOPE TIER excludes is scope, not
  drift; what it REQUIRES is an error when absent - at `product`, missing
  protection, filtering, connectors, thermal or enclosure fit. A dimension the
  BINDING relaxed is not drift: compare the board to the size the design
  EARNED and recorded as a decision, never to the stated number it beat.)
- Routing style (owner: straight and 45-degree traces, no needless arcs).
  `reports/checks/check_route_style.json` already scores the geometry: its
  `style` block counts arcs, off-45 segments and needless jogs, and each
  `route_style` finding lists the tracks (arcs and off-45 segments are
  errors that fail verify unless waived; jogs are warnings). Do not recount
  those. Look at the
  renders for what geometry cannot see: a trace wandering round a part it
  could pass straight, a bus whose members do not run parallel, a detour
  far longer than the gap it clears, staircases of 45s where one diagonal
  would do. Warning severity, `kind: route_style_visual`, domain router.
  The owner's U11 routing teaching may later turn this into rules.
- Checks that judged nothing: in `summary.json`, a check under
  `coverage.nothing_to_judge` (status `nothing_to_judge`) ran but found
  nothing it could judge (no MCU on an MCU check, no `length_groups` because
  `--constraints` wasn't passed). It fails no gate, and it is not a pass:
  confirm the board really has nothing of that kind. `coverage.not_judged`
  lists what a check that judged other things had to leave out (a part with
  no 3D model, a net with no declared edge rate); each entry is unreviewed.
- Waivers: a waiver that matches no finding is listed in the gate result as
  `waivers_unmatched` (and on stderr). It changes no grade on an advisory
  gate, but a strict gate (`verify_release`, `dfm_release`) fails on it, and
  an attestation naming it reads invalid. A waiver that carries `pos`
  matches only within 0.01 mm of it, so a finding that moved after a
  re-route kills that waiver even on the right net. Remove the entry or
  re-approve it against the current finding; don't copy old waivers forward
  unchecked.
- Warnings triage: every verify_all WARNING gets a verdict - real risk
  (escalate to error in your findings) or justified waiver (say why).
  Cold reviews of many boards rated these warnings respin-grade again and
  again: `esd_clamp_far` (clamp far along copper from the connector pin),
  `antenna_side_clearance` (copper beside the antenna, not under it) and
  `wick_via_in_pad` (an open via in a small pad). Read each one, never
  wave it through as a warning.
- Gaps no check covers yet, found by hand in those reviews: HASL ordered
  for a part at 0.5 mm pitch or finer (dfm has no finish-vs-pitch rule);
  a Kelvin sense pair that passes check_kelvin's resistance test but runs
  apart (it has no loop-area test), or a feedback or sense tap taken
  upstream of a load's drop; creepage or isolation that passes only
  because the declared voltage is low or missing (use the switch node's
  peak swing); prose in the design docs that the board contradicts; and a
  sim or measurement plan made on another stack-up than the board's.

## Findings format
`reports/review-board.md` (prose, worst first, reference render filenames)
AND `reports/review-board.json`: `{"violations": [{"check": "board-review",
"severity": "error|warning", "pos": [x, y]|null, "layer": "<or null>",
"net": "<or null>", "refs": [...], "msg": "<defect + consequence>",
"source": "review.board", "kind": "<short-slug>", "domain":
"router|placement|plane|silk|schematic|library|fab|parts|review",
"fault_class": "<docs/failure-modes.yaml id, or new>", "class_mode":
"<when new>"}]}` (the class: reference/first-spin.md, "Every fault class
becomes a check").
`domain` = the fixer that owns it (copper->router, part position->placement,
zone->plane, silk text->silk, value/net->schematic, footprint->library,
export->fab, sourcing->parts, unsure->review); it routes the work order.
Waiver recommendations go in the md with justification; the human decides
at checkpoint 4.
