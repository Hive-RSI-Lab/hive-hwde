"""report_gen.py - assemble a board's design document (LaTeX -> PDF) from its run workspace.

Reads state.json (read-only) plus the run's markdown/JSON/render artifacts and
writes reports/design_doc/<board>-design-doc.tex (other --kind: below), then compiles it to PDF with
lualatex (HWDE_LUALATEX pin, else PATH; two passes, staged in a system temp dir
so no .aux/.log/.toc litter ever lands in the git-tracked workspace). Every
kind is set in pdf-material-builder's house style: housestyle.sty and its
vendored Source Serif 4 / IBM Plex Mono are used by path from
HWDE_HOUSE_STYLE, else ~/.claude/skills/pdf-material-builder/references/
house-style (put on TEXINPUTS for the compile, never copied into hwde). Sections are conditional on the run's
phase: not-yet-due sections render a one-line "Pending" stub; due-but-absent
CORE artifacts (schematic.pdf, a board render, bom_rows, order.json) are
violations, everything else absent is a warning. All external text goes
through latex_escape (total function; the final .tex is asserted pure ASCII).

Asset paths embedded in run JSON are unreliably backslashed and mixed
repo-/workspace-relative, so every asset is resolved by this script's own
ladder relative to the workspace root and emitted with forward slashes.

The Run Record carries the model cost of generating the board from
reports/cost.json (gen_cost.py): the total, the split by step or the reason
there is none. A missing cost.json is a warning and a "not recorded" line.

The DFM section states the board's castellated pads from bom_cpl.json (else
order.json's spec snapshot): the count and refs when there are some, "none"
when there are none - and then a brief/brief.md or architecture/*.md line
that claims castellation (and does not deny it) is a warning.

A finished PDF is filed with `cc-docs file` only when asked: `--file` (the
command a person or session runs to finish a report) or DOC_PROJECT set in the
environment. A board document already in the library (report_gen.
filed_document: its source in reports/<kind>/ of this board's directory, or
its last revision describing this part number) is filed under its own
project and exact title, so the rebuild is its next revision even from
another worktree, where cc-docs' source-path match misses. Else it files
into DOC_PROJECT, or the project "Boards" (002), as "<PN> <board> design
doc" ("<board> design doc" with no part number).
With neither, the PDF is built and nothing is filed, so test runs and
scratch builds never reach the register. A filing that succeeds leaves
reports/design_doc/.filed.json (a hash of the .tex, its "generated" time
left out, and of the images it includes, plus the project and the cc-docs
library, CC_DOCS_ROOT or "" for the default); a rebuild whose stamp matches
files nothing and sets the payload's `unchanged`, so filing into a scratch
library never stops the live one from getting the revision. A failed filing,
or cc-docs missing from PATH, only warns and leaves the stamp alone.
The filing names the board's part number with --describes PCB-NNNN-R when
the boards register lists the workspace (lib/boardreg.py; hwde never
allocates one), and passes --cost <step>=<usd> once per step of
reports/cost.json. The part number is also printed under the title, in
every page's running head beside the board name, and as a row of the metadata
table ("not in the boards register" otherwise). The payload's `filed` is
cc-docs' first output line (the number and path) when this run filed, else
null; `unchanged` is true when a matching stamp skipped the filing.
A filing also puts the board's fab set on the revision it filed or found
unchanged, every name led by the workspace directory's name <ws> (owner,
#ai-ee: "name the files all with the prefix of the project name"):
fab/<ws>_gerbers.zip, fab/BOM.csv and fab/CPL.csv as <ws>_BOM.csv and
<ws>_CPL.csv (copied under those names in a temp dir; the JLC tooling keeps
the bare ones), and fab/<ws>_BOM_digikey.csv, <ws>_BOM_mouser.csv and
<ws>_BOM_cost.json, each only when present. It is a second call,
`cc-docs attach <number> --replace`, because `cc-docs file --attach`
refuses a changed file on an unchanged revision and refuses the PDF with it
when a file is over a cap. The stamp carries each attached file's hash, so a
fab set that changed under an unchanged PDF still goes up; a failed attach
warns and leaves the stamp alone. The payload's `attached` lists the names
put up this run. A board with no fab set files as before. The workspace may be named by its directory, the board's old name or
its part number (lib/boardreg.py resolves the last two).
--note TEXT (only with --file) is the filed revision's note, passed as
`cc-docs file --note`; an unchanged rebuild files nothing and warns that
the note was dropped.

The Verification section (and the highlight's Checks and Cost) lists the
board's accepted verify waivers, one item each: what fires (check, kind),
where (net, refs, pos), the reason, `approved` (who accepted it and when)
and `expires`, each only when the entry has it. They are read as the verify
gate reads them (releaselib.waivers_for_input + gate.load_waivers); a file
the gate would refuse is a warning and a line saying so, and a board with
no reports/verify-waivers.json gets nothing. The highlight cuts each reason
at HL_REASON_CAP characters.

--kind picks the document (KINDS): `design` (the default, everything above),
`highlight` (a few pages: the brief's opening, the board's facts, top and
bottom renders, the BOM and the schematic's first page, the decisions that
changed the board, how often the run went back, gates and cost) or `full`
(the design doc plus a render of every routing/pre-* and post-* (or pre_*, post_*) snapshot,
every state.json decision with its why, the run's history - phase timeline,
backtracks, part choices and the kicad/parts.json changes git shows, commits
by hour, COMPARISON.md and the placement and routing notes - and a figure of
how the run went, drawn by the diagram-maker skill from reports/design_full/
flow.json; lib/dochistory.py reads all of it). Each kind writes its own
reports/<design_doc|highlight|design_full>/ and files as its own document
("<PN> <board> design doc", "... highlight doc", "... full design doc").
--render-history renders the snapshots first (render.py, top view; a PNG
newer than its board is kept); without it only PNGs already there are shown
and a warning says so. The metadata table (the highlight's facts table too)
has a design spend row, 'USD <actual> of a USD <cap> cap', from the optional
reports/design_spend.json (actual_usd, cap_usd, source, as_of) that the
boards repo writes; without it the row says 'not recorded'. The full doc also gets Board Layers - one page per
copper layer, front to back, drawn as KiCad shows it with the net names on
its pads, tracks and zones, then the top, bottom and iso 3D views - and the
highlight gets the outer two layers and the iso view. layer_views.py draws
them into reports/layers/ (layers.json lists them), which both kinds share;
--render-layers runs it first unless its layers.json is newer than the
board and says pass (a failed run is drawn again), and without it only what is already there is shown, with a warning. --history-ref names the git ref whose log is the
history (a board squash-merged into the boards repo keeps its run on its
track branch). The figure needs node and the diagram-maker skill
(HWDE_DIAGRAM_MAKER, else ~/.claude/skills/diagram-maker); without them it
is a warning and a line saying why.

Exit 0 "pass"   = requested outputs produced (--tex-only: the .tex alone).
Exit 1 "violations" = degraded: compile failed, lualatex or the house style
                  absent (auto tex-only), or core artifacts missing for the
                  run's phase.
Exit 2 "error"  = unusable workspace / internal error (a bad HWDE_LUALATEX
                  pin propagates here - loud, never degraded).
