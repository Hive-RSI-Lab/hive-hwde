"""cpl_verify.py - does each machine-placed part land with pin 1 on pad 1?

JLC places a part the way its LCSC footprint model is drawn in EasyEDA, turned
by the CPL rotation and put at the CPL position. A package table cannot know
that model (the '^SOT-23,180' row turned the owner's SOT-23-5/6 parts 180 deg),
so this check reads each `smt_placed` part's own model (lib/easyeda.py, cached
per LCSC number) and fits it onto the board footprint:

  rotation  The model's pads are matched to the board footprint's pads BY
            NUMBER. The correction c is the turn (a multiple of 90 deg, else
            45 deg) that puts every shared pad number on its board pad, after
            centring both pad sets (each model pad nearer its own board pad
            than any other). The CPL must say (board rotation + c) mod
            360 on the top and (180 - board rotation + c) mod 360 on the
            bottom (see "bottom side"); anything else is `wrong_rotation`,
            with the rotation it needs. A two-pad part that is not polarised
            may also sit at c + 180.
  polarity  Diodes, LEDs and polarised caps are also matched BY ROLE: the
            model's cathode / + pin (its symbol pin names) must land on the
            board's cathode / + pad (the pad's pinfunction, else the KiCad
            library convention: D_/LED_ pad 1 = K, CP_ pad 1 = +, else - for
            a footprint pulled from the same LCSC part - the model's own
            numbering, else a two-pad LED* footprint on a D/LED refdes, pad
            1 = K as KiCad's Device:LED numbers it). Where roles are named on
            both sides they decide the rotation, even when the numbers fit
            another way (C2286's pad 2 is its K, so pin 1 goes on pad 2): a
            CPL at that number fit puts K on A and is `wrong_polarity`. With no K/A or +/- names on one side (LCSC
            symbols for polarised caps say "1"/"2"), polarity is checked by
            pad number, and a 180-degree turn is never accepted for it.
  no data   No LCSC number, no cached or fetchable model, fewer than two
            shared pad numbers or no turn that fits is a FAILURE, never a
            pass - `no_model` or `no_fit`. A model fetch that errored (network, HTTP status) is `fetch_failed`,
            never `no_model`: it says nothing about the part or its pin 1.
            A 403/429 is EasyEDA's rate limit: later parts are not fetched
            (also `fetch_failed`) and the report's `rate_limited` says why.
  footprint A ball grid with no model (no LCSC number, or EasyEDA has none) is
            checked against the package's own A1 corner, read from its ball
            names: CPL = board rotation + the turn from a part with A1 upper
            left, columns running right (IPC-7351 Level A). `basis: footprint`.
            A match is `footprint_match`, a warning and never a pass: JLC's
            zero is the part's tape orientation and it publishes no BGA rule
            (reference/jlc_bga_cpl.md). A mismatch is `wrong_rotation`. Names
            that give no A1 (a mirrored land pattern, a skewed grid) stay
            `no_model`. A fetch that failed, or an LCSC number not yet fetched
            under --offline, gets no footprint verdict: the model can answer.
            Position isn't checked on this basis.
  offset    The model's pad centre vs the board's, both placed, is reported
            (`offset_mm`); over OFFSET_WARN_MM it is a warning only. The
            limit shrinks with the pad pitch (`offset_limit_mm`: 0.4 x the
            closest pad centres, never over OFFSET_WARN_MM): a part whose
            limit is below that (a 0.5 mm BGA: 0.2 mm) is `wrong_offset`, a
            failure, because the offset alone leaves its balls half off.

Bottom side. The board is viewed from below, turned about its y axis (x -> -x,
as a page is turned), with the part read from its own side. Writing R(a) for a
turn and M for KiCad's flip (local y -> -y, which the board file already holds
in a flipped footprint's pads), the pads sit at R(r) M L, with L the unflipped
land pattern and the model fitting it as R(c) model = L. The view from below is
V = diag(-1, 1), and V R(r) M R(c) = R(180 - r + c). So the part is fitted
against the pads un-flipped, and the CPL rotation is (180 - r + c) mod 360. A
flip about the x axis instead would give (-r + c): that 180 degrees is exactly
what the choice of view decides, and geometry alone can't choose it.

The choice comes from two community exporters, not from JLC: Bouni
kicad-jlcpcb-tools (fabrication.py, "bottom angles need to be mirrored on
Y-axis": (180 - rotation) % 360, correction added after) and bennymeg
Fabrication-Toolkit (process.py, "JLC expect 'Rotation' to be 'as viewed from
above component'": 180.0 - rotation, offsets added after). JLC's order preview
is what settles it, so a passing bottom part still gets `bottom_preview` in the
report and a dfm warning (cpl_bottom_preview). reference/jlc_bottom_cpl.md has
the record; add what a preview or a built board shows there.

`derive_rotation()` is what bom_cpl.py uses to WRITE the CPL; the package table
is only its fallback when this check has no model. `merge_visual()` puts the
fab step's image verdict (cpl_render.py + the playbook's vision agent, file
`cpl_visual.json`) beside the script verdict: a part the two disagree on, or
one the visual pass skipped, fails.

CLI:
  cpl_verify.py --pcb board.kicad_pcb --cpl fab/CPL.csv
                [--parts parts.json] [--cache-dir DIR] [--offline]
                [--visual fab/cpl_visual.json] [--out report.json]
LCSC numbers come from the board's footprint fields, overridden by parts.json.
The cache is $HWDE_EASYEDA_CACHE, else <parts.json dir>/easyeda (made on the
first fetch - commit it), else ~/.cache/hwde/easyeda (env.easyeda_cache), which
is also read when the board's has no copy; --offline (or HWDE_EASYEDA_OFFLINE=1)
never fetches.
Exit 0 every part verified / 1 a part is wrong or unverified / 2 error.
In a board workspace each part's `footprint` fact goes into its ledger.json
(record_footprints, lib/ledgerlib.py) - from dfm's placement leg too.
