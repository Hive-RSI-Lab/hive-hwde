"""board_swig.py - SWIG worker for board_init.py / board_edit.py. BUNDLED
python only.

Runs under KiCad's bundled python.exe (the only interpreter with `pcbnew`),
launched as a subprocess by the venv driver. Consumes a JSON job on argv; the
`verb` key selects the operation (absent = "build", board_init's original job
shape).

Every job runs under safelib.board_locks(job): an OS writer lock on the
"board" and "out" .kicad_pcb (<pcb>.lock), held from LoadBoard to Save;
a second worker on the same board waits, then refuses (LockBusy).

verb "build" (board_init, SPEC P5): places every footprint from a netlist
netmap onto a fresh board, assigns pad nets, spreads parts on a shelf grid (no
courtyard overlaps), draws the outline and mounting holes, and saves an
UNFILLED board. Mirrors the corpus builder tests/golden/generators/pcb_build.py;
zone fill (if any) is a later kicad-cli step - pcbnew.ZONE_FILLER segfaults
headless (LEARNINGS [swig]).

  out            output .kicad_pcb path
  layers         2 | 4 | 6 ... 32 (copper layers, even)
  components     [{ref, value, fp:"Lib:Name"}, ...]
  netmap         {"REF.PAD": "netname", ...}
  skip_unconnected_nets  bool - leave pads on `unconnected-*` pseudo-nets NETLESS
                 (board_init sets it after measuring what parity wants)
  fp_paths       [dir, ...] searched for "<Lib>.pretty/<Name>.kicad_mod"

  outline        {mode:"auto"} | {mode:"fixed", w, h}
  origin         [x, y] mm | null: pin the outline's top-left corner there,
                 the packed parts moving with it (board_init --origin keeps a
                 re-run's coordinates where the last run put them)
  corner_radius  mm; 0 = square; null/absent = AUTO_CORNER_RADIUS, capped at
                 a tenth of the shorter side so a tiny board keeps its area
  mounting_holes {count: 0..4 | "auto", fp:"Lib:Name", inset, cu_edge,
                  hole_to_hole} | null
                 "auto" = 4 when the shorter side >= AUTO_HOLES_MIN_SIDE, else
                 none. A hole with plated copper (the *_Pad_Via default) sits
                 at least its copper radius + cu_edge in from each edge, the
                 auto outline widens its border so corner parts clear the
                 hole's courtyard (a fixed outline is not widened, so there
                 "auto" gives none unless the parts already sit that border
                 in from every edge), and its pads join the ground net
                 (GND_NET_RE) so the ring is stitched, not floating.
                 A footprint whose OWN drills sit closer than hole_to_hole
                 (the fab floor, edge to edge) is swapped for its plain
                 *_Pad sibling (same hole, no via ring) or refused - KiCad's
                 small *_Pad_Via rings (M2, M2.5) are 0.35-0.425 mm apart,
                 below every JLC profile's 0.5 mm.

The board lands in the positive quadrant (outline top-left at least
OUTLINE_MIN_XY from the page origin), with the aux (drill/place) and grid
origins at the outline's lower-left corner.

verb "set_outline" (board_edit, U17): REPLACES the Edge.Cuts graphics of an
EXISTING board with a new rectangle (optionally rounded / notched), touching
nothing else. Same draw_outline() as "build", so an edited outline and an
initialized one are the same geometry by construction.

  board          input .kicad_pcb (the driver stages a copy)
  out            output .kicad_pcb path
  rect           [x1, y1, x2, y2] absolute mm (aux/grid origin -> x1, y2)
  corner_radius  mm (0 = square)
  cutouts        [{x, y, w, h}, ...] relative to rect's top-left, edge notches
