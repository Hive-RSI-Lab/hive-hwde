"""matinglib - can every mating connector on the board actually be mated?

Shared by the P6 place gate (place_metrics.py, family "mating") and the P8
verify gate (check_mating.py), so the fault fails at placement and stays
failed if a later edit brings it back.

Which footprints are mating connectors, and their plug geometry, come from
reference/connector_mating.yaml (see its header). Three violation kinds, all
error severity, each naming the connector in `connector` (refs also lists
the blocking parts):

  mating_faces_inward  a horizontal connector's mouth faces away from its
                       nearest board edge (PCB-0021-A J4: USB-A with its back
                       at the edge and its mouth toward L1).
  mating_mouth_inset   the mouth faces the nearest edge but sits more than
                       mouth_tol_mm inside it.
  mating_zone_blocked  a part on the connector's side sits in the insertion
                       zone in front of the mouth (horizontal), or a part
                       taller than tall_mm sits within finger_mm of a
                       vertical connector.

  mating_model_reversed  a horizontal connector's 3D model points the other
                       way from its copper: the model lies behind the contact
                       pads, so every render shows the mouth facing into the
                       board while the pads face the edge, or the other way
                       round (PCB-0023-A J101/J102/J501: an edge-launch SMA
                       whose model is turned 180 degrees).

A connector whose mate lies on the board itself (an FPC socket taking the
tail of a display that sits on this board) does not mate from an edge, so
the board's constraints.json declares it under placement.mates:

  {"ref": "J2", "mate": "onboard_flex",
   "corridor": [[x1, y1, x2, y2], ...], "mate_refs": ["DS1"],
   "reason": "the LCD's tail lies on the top side into J2"}

The corridor is the rectangles the flex lies over (its real outline, board
mm). For a declared connector the edge rule (faces_inward, mouth_inset) and
the plug-shaped insertion zone give way to two errors:

  mating_mate_misaligned  the corridor does not cross the connector's mouth
                       face, so the declared flex cannot reach the socket.
  mating_zone_blocked  a part on the connector's side (other than
                       mate_refs, the parts that are the mate) sits in the
                       corridor.

and mating_mate_invalid for an entry that names no part on the board, an
unknown mate kind, or no corridor. model_reversed still applies.

There is also one warning, mating_direction_unknown, for a horizontal connector whose
pad layout is symmetric about its body: it asks for a `mouth` entry in the
table rather than guessing.

Mouth direction is read from the pad layout: the contact pads (the most
common pad size) sit at the back of the housing and the body extends toward
the mouth, so the mouth points from the contact-pad centroid toward the
courtyard centroid. The table's `mouth` map overrides that per footprint.

A connector whose SMD pads sit on both outer copper layers straddles the
board edge (an edge-launch SMA, a card-edge socket), so it is checked as
horizontal even when its name matched a vertical family: a name is a hint,
the copper is the part.

The 3D model's direction is read against the same contact pads: its
bounding box, put through the footprint's model offset/rotate/scale the way
KiCad's 3D viewer does, must reach ahead of them toward the mouth. A box
cannot tell a model turned round from one pushed back, so only a model that
lies wholly behind the contacts fails (model_reversed); one that is merely
offset passes. Only a .wrl is read (beside the board, or the .wrl twin of a .step
model); a connector without one is listed in the facts, never failed.

Part heights (vertical rule) come from the 3D model: a "-H<mm>" in the model
or footprint name, else the highest vertex of a .wrl model found beside the
board (VRML units are 2.54 mm). A part with no readable height is listed in
the facts, never failed.
