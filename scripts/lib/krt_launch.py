"""Run a KRT script with hwde's patches (#489, #529).

  python krt_launch.py [--layer-widths W.json] [--via-joint-ends]
                       [--hole-to-hole MM] [--escape-open O.json] SCRIPT ARGS...

--layer-widths (#489): KRT (KiCadRoutingTools 0.19.0) draws each layer at
  GridRouteConfig.layer_widths[layer] when that map is set, but only its own
  --impedance option fills it, from KRT's own solver. hwde wants the widths
  rules_gen wrote into the .kicad_dru (zrules.layer_geometry), so the
  router, rules_gen and DRC agree. W.json = {"F.Cu": 0.0948, "In2.Cu":
  0.0889}. A run that already sets layer_widths (KRT's --impedance) keeps
  its own.

--via-joint-ends (#529): KRT's connectivity.find_stub_free_ends clusters a
  stub's endpoints per (x, y, layer), so a dog-bone escape (ball -> F.Cu
  neck -> via -> In2 stub to the field edge) reports the via joint itself
  as a "free end" on F.Cu and on In2, beside the real tip. route_diff picks
  its terminals among the free ends by P-N spacing, every candidate ties at
  the ball pitch, and the first one (the via, deep in the ball field) wins:
  the pair then has no room to launch (no-escape-path). With this flag a
  free end that coincides with an endpoint of the same group on ANOTHER
  layer (a via joint) is not a free end; a group whose only ends are such
  joints keeps KRT's answer.

--hole-to-hole MM (#552): KRT checks drill hole-to-hole against its own
  constant (routing_defaults.HOLE_TO_HOLE_CLEARANCE, JLC's 0.20 via-to-via
  spacing), not the --fab-overrides value. A board whose floor is wider
  (rules_gen's aiee_hole_to_hole_floor, 0.5 on JLC 6L) then gets dog-bone
  gap vias 0.566 mm from a via-in-pad at 0.8 mm pitch: hole_to_hole and
  hole_clearance errors DRC rips both nets for. The constant is raised to
  MM (never lowered) before KRT imports it.

--escape-open O.json (#547): KRT's dog-bone engine escapes every ball and
  every coupled pair toward the NEARER edge of the ball field. O.json =
  {"open": {"/DRAM_SDCLK0_P": ["left", "up"], ...}} names, per net, the
  field sides (board axes, up = -y) its escape may leave by. KRT's
  under-pad/dog-bone engine (bga_fanout/underpad.py) is re-compiled from
  its own source with four edits (escape_open_source): the A* goal is
  "outside the field on an open side" for such a net and the margin past a
  closed side is not walkable; a coupled pair (side-by-side or end-on) does
  not try a closed direction; the dog-bone gap site prefers the nearest
  OPEN side. Nets not named escape as before. Each edit must match KRT's
  source exactly once, else the launch fails (a KRT bump needs a look).

The KRT script itself runs unchanged (runpy).
