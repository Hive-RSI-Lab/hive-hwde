"""necklib - where a power net may run at its courtyard-held neck width (#924, #937).

rules_gen's aiee_pwr_neck lets a power net narrow inside the courtyard of a
part whose pads are narrower than the net's width rule. route_finish read
those rules first (#924); route_escape and route_auto read them here too, so
a fine-pitch power ball gets out at every stage, not only at close.

board_necks(pcb, bg, neck_rules) -> {net: {layer: [(zone, width)]}}. A zone
is the footprint's courtyard (what the rule's intersectsCourtyard reads) cut
to NECK_REACH_MM round the net's own pads of that part on the layer, so a
neck stays the pad's escape check_current accepts (its 1 mm pad-exit bound),
not a narrow trace across the part.

neck_width(necks, net, layer, shape) -> the narrowest neck width whose zone
holds the whole shape (a point, a track's centre line), or None.
