"""bgalib.py - BGA ball fields and their escape budget (#325).

One place answers "which footprints are ball grids, at what pitch, and what
via / track / clearance escapes them at this board's fab floors", so the
router (route_escape.py) and the rule writer (rules_gen.py) can never
disagree about the clearance an escape is laid at:

  find_bgas(bg)               -> [Bga]: footprints whose SMD pads sit on a
                                 regular grid (>= 3 x 3, pitch <= 1.27 mm)
  escape_params(bga, floors)  -> the dog-bone escape geometry and its budget
  dru_rule(ref, clearance)    -> the courtyard-scoped clearance rule text

The budget (all mm, c = escape clearance):
  via     = max(min via diameter, drill + 2 * min annular ring)
  c       = max(min clearance, hole clearance - via ring) - a track laid at
            c from the via copper is then also hole-clear of its drill
  street  = pitch - via >= track + 2c       one track between dog-bone vias
  gap     = pitch / sqrt2 >= pad/2 + via/2 + c   a via fits the diagonal gap
  channel = pitch - pad >= track + 2c       one track between balls (top)
A field that fails `gap` cannot be dog-boned at standard vias (0.5 mm
eMMC); a sparse one may still escape between its NC balls.

Not a CLI - library only.
