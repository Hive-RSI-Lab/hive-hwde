"""board_init.py - initialize a .kicad_pcb from a netlist (SPEC P5).

board-setup phase, script-driven: create the board, import the netlist
(footprints + net assignments), set the stackup from stackups.yaml, draw a
provisional outline and mounting holes. Placement proper is P6 - board_init
just spreads parts legally (no courtyard overlaps) so DRC setup is clean.

kicad-cli has NO netlist->board path, so the import runs under KiCad's bundled
python via lib/board_swig.py (the only interpreter with pcbnew), mirroring the
corpus builder. The venv driver here parses the netlist (sexpdata), picks the
stackup, drives the worker, injects the (stackup) block as text (SWIG can't
serialize it - LEARNINGS [swig]), writes a minimal .kicad_pro, and self-checks.

The .kicad_pro's design-rule minimums come from the selected JLC capability
profile via lib/fabfloors.py - never from a hard-coded default - and the
checks that enforce them are pinned to severity ERROR. Two shipped boards
proved why: a hard-coded `min_track_width: 0.1` (below EVERY JLC profile)
plus KiCad's default `min_hole_to_hole: 0.25` at *warning* let 189 unbuildable
traces and two sub-fab drill pairs pass `drc_routed` 0/0 and only surface at
the P9 DFM gate (LEARNINGS [board_init][rules_gen][dfm][gates]).

A new board looks finished by default: corners rounded (AUTO_CORNER_RADIUS,
capped at a tenth of the shorter side) and, once the shorter side reaches
AUTO_HOLES_MIN_SIDE, four M3 mounting holes that are plated with an exposed
copper ring and a ring of vias (MountingHole_3.2mm_M3_Pad_Via), joined to the
ground net. A fixed --outline is not widened for them, so there "auto" gives
none when the packed parts reach closer to an edge than a corner hole needs,
and the report's mounting_holes_skipped says so. A brief that wants none, a bare NPTH hole or another size says so
with --mounting-holes 0 / --mounting-hole-fp / --corner-radius 0, and wins.

The outline's top-left corner stays where the board already has it: a re-run
over an existing board keeps its origin (--origin keep, the default), so
absolute coordinates written against the first run (constraints planes,
pre-route ops) still land. Without it the origin follows the parts' packed
extent and moved on every netlist change: a VBUS stub landed 0.3 mm off and
shorted a GND pad (hifi-receiver-2 lite-main). --origin X,Y pins it; --origin
auto is the packed position. The report gives it as outline_origin and says
where it came from (origin_source).

The outline is PROVISIONAL. Under a build mode whose binding makes geometry an
output (`state.py mode`, reference/build-modes.md) a fixed `--outline WxH` is
built as asked and the report says the size did not come from the placement
(`build_mode.fixed_outline_override`, a worker note): the usual route is
`--outline auto`, place, then `board_edit --outline fit`.

Self-check acceptance (SPEC S8): schematic parity == 0 (every part+net imported
correctly) AND zero setup DRC violations, EXCLUDING unconnected_items (the board
is unrouted by design), AND the written project's floors >= the fab profile.
Emits the normalized DRC report alongside.
