"""check_connector_fit.py - does each part's metal go where its drawing says?
(P8 verify suite)

The hits (hifi-receiver-2 first-spin review, 2026-10-29): core's RCA jacks
sat on a footprint with no holes for their locating posts, so the posts
stood on the board top and the signal pins never reached the solder side
(DFM-1); Ultra's TOSLINK was a T8BK on a T10BK footprint (DFM-12). Every
gate passed: nothing compared the footprint with the part's mechanical
drawing. A reviewer did it by hand; this check does it on every board.

The drawing comes from the part's datasheet extraction, <parts>/<LCSC>.json,
its `mechanical` block (datasheet_extract.py; `--render` puts the drawing
pages beside the text, OCR'd when they are scans):

  pins   [{pads?, dia_mm | w_mm + t_mm, hole_mm?}]  the leads' max
         cross-section; `pads` defaults to every numbered plated hole
  posts  [{count, dia_mm | w_mm + t_mm, hole_mm?}]  locating posts or pegs,
         each needing a hole of its own
  edge   {overhang_mm, tol_mm?}  how far the body's front stands past the
         PCB edge line on the drawing (negative: set back behind it)

Findings:
  tht_pin_tight       error: a lead's cross-section (a rectangular pin's
                      diagonal, or per axis in a slot) leaves less than
                      PIN_CLEAR_MM in its hole - at JLC's -0.08 mm
                      plated-hole tolerance it may not go in at all
  tht_hole_ipc2222    warning (one per part): a round hole that takes the
                      lead but is under IPC-2222 9.2.1's minimum, the lead's
                      max diameter (a square/rect lead's diagonal) + 0.15 mm
                      (level C; B 0.20, A 0.25). A 0.64 mm square header pin
                      wants 1.055 mm; KiCad's stock 1.0 mm drill fits in
                      practice but leaves no room for solder to wet through
  tht_hole_loose      warning: a round hole more than LOOSE_MM over the
                      lead (poor wetting, the part leans)
  tht_hole_under_spec warning: the hole is under the drawing's hole_mm by
                      more than SPEC_TOL_MM
  tht_pad_missing     error: a pad the drawing's pins name is not a plated
                      hole on the footprint (SMD, or no such pad)
  post_holes_missing  error: fewer holes that fit a post than the drawing
                      has posts (holes the pins do not use count; a hole too
                      small for the post is named)
  edge_overhang_off   error: the body's front stands past the board edge
                      by a different amount than the drawing says, beyond
                      tol_mm (default EDGE_TOL_MM); a warning when the body
                      outline is only the courtyard (no F.Fab, no 3D model)

Every mating connector's front vs Edge.Cuts is reported in the facts
(`edges`: overhang_mm and where the body outline came from: F.Fab, the 3D
model's box or the courtyard), drawing or not; connectors whose extraction
has no `mechanical` block are listed under `unverified`, so a review sees
what this check could not hold to a drawing. A part with no extraction is
never failed for it. A part with no `mechanical.pins` whose footprint is a
stock pin header is held to reference/tht_leads.yaml's lead instead (the
part's fact says `lead_source: stock`).

A solder-wire pad pair (KiCad's Connector_Wire:SolderWire-*) has no part
and no drawing: its holes are sized for the wire the footprint is named
for. With no extraction, the wire is sized from the copper that feeds the
pads instead (`wire_feed`): the widths of the same-net tracks ending on a
pad, plus a thermal-relief pour's spokes, give a current (IPC-2221 outer
layer, WIRE_DT_C rise), the current gives the least wire that carries it
(IEC 60335-1 Table 11), and the wire's conductor (KiCad's own table) is
the lead. A pad tied solid to a pour, or one fed by nothing, is not
judged. One tht_hole_loose per part, `lead_source: wire` (oasis J1,
issue #881: 2.5 mm^2 holes for a 0.5 mm wide feed).
