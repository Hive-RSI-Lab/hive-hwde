"""check_ratings.py - every pin's datasheet rating against the net it sits on (P4/P8).

One concern: a pin driven past what its datasheet allows - an over-voltage
input, a reversed rail, an input above its own supply, a regulator output
asked for more than it can give. No DRC sees this class; it is a respin.

Inputs (pure Python, no KiCad run):
 - the board (--pcb): footprint refs, their `LCSC` / `LCSC Part` property,
   and the net on every pad;
 - the parts directory (--parts, default <ws>/parts beside <ws>/kicad):
   parts.json (the P3 BOM, per-part `attributes`) and the per-part
   extraction <LCSC>.json that datasheet_extract.py validates (pinout +
   abs_max, optional pin_ratings);
 - rail voltages, first source wins per net: constraints.json `voltages`
   (--constraints; worst-case volts), the power tree's rail table
   (--power-tree, default <ws>/architecture/power_tree.md: a markdown table
   whose second header cell says V/volt), a fixed-output regulator's output
   pin (AMS1117-3.3, L78L33: the MPN's voltage on its VOUT/OUT power_out
   pin), then the net name (+5V, 3V3, +12V, -5V, VBUS = 5 V; GND*/VSS* = 0).
   A signal net with no voltage of its own takes the highest rail it is
   pulled up to through a 2-pad resistor.

Ratings per pin: the extraction's structured `pin_ratings` entries first
(pins, kind voltage|current, level abs_max|recommended, min/max as a number
or "VDD+0.3", optional ref pin), else its free-text `abs_max` rows parsed:
a row names its pins (VIN, EN, "V(IN)", VEN -> EN, IIN -> IN), a class
("any other pin", "5 V tolerant" -> pins whose notes say FT/5 V tolerant,
"supply" -> power_in, "input"/"output"), or a pair (VGS, "BST-SW",
"with respect to SW" - rated against the ref pin's net, not ground). A row
whose param says operating/recommended is a recommended rating. Pulse,
transient, ESD, clamp, injected and differential-input rows are skipped.
A named pin outranks a class; the tightest bound of the best tier wins.

Findings (kind = violation `kind`, remediations under reference/remediations/):
 - rating_over_voltage (error): net above an absolute maximum - including a
   bound relative to the part's own supply (an input above supply);
   a 2-pad part's `Voltage Rated` attribute below the volts across it.
 - rating_reverse_polarity (error): net below an absolute minimum (a
   negative single figure, as P-channel parts print, is that minimum), or
   a ground pin sitting on a positive rail.
   Either is a warning, not an error, when the net's volts came through a
   pull-up: that resistor may be a deliberate series limit into a clamped
   pin. A supply pin fed through a resistor is not given the rail's volts.
   A 2-terminal diode (D*/LED*) with no extraction is rated by a parts.json
   reverse-voltage attribute ("Reverse Voltage (Vr)"), its cathode found by
   pad name (the board's pinfunction, else the netlist <board>.net beside
   it) or else pad 1, KiCad's convention.
   Reversed input (warning, field `scenario`): each 2-net power input - a
   J/P/CN/X/BT part on one ground and one positive rail, a header, jack or
   battery that plugs in either way - is plugged in reversed: its rail goes
   to minus its volts, carried through lone series R/L/FB parts (a blocking
   diode draws no current), and every diode it then reverse-biases past its
   reverse rating is named. "The LED blocks reverse current" is checked
   against the LED's VR, not taken on trust.
 - rating_outside_recommended (warning): above a recommended max, or a
   supply pin below its recommended min.
 - rating_over_current (warning): a power_out pin whose net's
   constraints `power[].current_a` exceeds the pin's current rating.
   A fuse or PPTC (F*/FU*, or a parts.json hold-current attribute) carrying
   a constraints power[].current_a: over its rating at the ambient is an
   error, a fuse past 75 % of its rerated current (k_T, Littelfuse) or a
   PPTC whose Ihold at the ambient (typical Bourns/Littelfuse table) clears
   the current by under 10 % a warning (R-RAT-3, R-RAT-4).
 - rating_unrated (warning): a part with no rating to check a connected
   pin against - no extraction, no row that names or classes the pin, or a
   relative bound whose reference supply has no known voltage. One per
   part, listing the pins. Never a silent pass.
 - rating_no_attributes (error): a rated part (diode, fuse, regulator, cap,
   a power-IC family: charge pump, ideal diode, hot-swap controller)
   whose parts.json row has empty `attributes` and which nothing else rates:
   its limit was never compared, so the gate fails until the row is filled
   (parts_enrich.py). A U/VR/IC part whose MPN carries a known family's output
   code counts as a regulator here, whatever its words. One per BOM code,
   naming its refs. The check reads
   nothing but the row: no cache, no network. Its ledger fact stays unknown.
 - rating_over_voltage, also: a chip resistor's volts across it above its
   limiting element voltage (parts.json Voltage-Supply(Max), else the chip
   size's D/CRCW e3 Umax; R-RAT-1); a fuse or PPTC whose voltage rating is
   under the rail it sits on (it must hold the rail off once open); an
   unextracted regulator whose input or enable pad sits above the input
   rating its filled row gives (regulator_findings; no pad names: its
   highest-voltage net, unless the part steps up); an unextracted power IC
   whose input pad, from its family's datasheet table (POWER_IC_FAMILIES),
   sits above the top of its filled row's input range, which is the
   recommended maximum on every family in the table (power_ic_findings). Its
   rating_unrated says what became of the inputs: an input it can't compare, or
   else that they are within the row (power_ic_why_unrated).
 - rating_regulator_output (error): a regulator whose output pad sits on a
   rail its row (or a fixed output in the MPN, or a known family's MPN code)
   says it can't make, or on a stated rail of the wrong sign for a part its
   family or words call positive or negative. Unextracted: a pad named in the
   netlist. Extracted: a power_out pin named as an output, against a rail the
   board itself states (constraints, power tree, net name); its output may
   also come from the extraction.
 - rating_regulator_output_unjudged (warning): a regulator where nothing says
   what it makes. Extracted: with an output pin on the board. Unextracted:
   with a filled row.
 - rating_over_temperature (error): the board's ambient above a part's
   operating range (parts.json "Operating Temperature", or the
   extraction's operating_temp_c), or constraints ambient_min_c below it
   (R-REL-2). The ambient is constraints ambient_c, else the enclosure air
   check_thermal works out, else 25 C, said so in `ambient`.
 - rating_datasheet_suspect (warning): a part whose datasheet PDF is a host
   placeholder or was judged suspect (index.json: cut off, no text layer, nothing
   ties it to the MPN; #706). The PDFs on disk are judged when the index is read
   (#768). The ledger facts read from that PDF (the extraction's source_pdf
   says which one) are unknown, never verified; a rating that came from the
   distributor or a package table was not read from it and is untouched (#781).
 - rating_datasheet_unassessed (warning, one per board): parts whose datasheet
   can't be judged here: an index.json entry with no PDF on disk, or a PDF with
   no MPN to check it against. `datasheet_extract --fetch` gets the PDF (#755).
 - rating_no_datasheet_read (warning, one per board): parts whose rating fact
   is `listed`, a number compared with no datasheet behind it (#781). It names
   the way to `verified`: `datasheet_extract --fetch`, then extraction.
 - rating_listing_disagrees (warning, one per part): the distributor's voltage
   rating and the datasheet's differ by over 10 % on the same rating (#799),
   whatever the rail. `side` high means the listing overstates the part, the
   direction a `listed` rating can't catch. `check_used` says which number the
   rating check read: `datasheet` (an extracted part is never judged on its
   listing), or `none` when no pin met a known rail. Every comparison is in
   facts `listing_comparison`.
Sources and verified/disputed tags: docs/ingest/safety-components.md.
A pin on a net of unknown voltage is not a finding (counted in facts).

The fact ledger (lib/ledgerlib.py): each refdes gets a `rating` fact (verified
when a datasheet's rating was compared with known volts and held, listed when
the number was the distributor's or a package table's, `rated_from` says which;
failed on an error finding, unknown when unrated or nothing could be compared)
and a
`pinout` fact (pinout_fact: the board's pad numbers and names against the
extraction's pinout; no extraction is unknown). Written into <ws>/ledger.json
when the board sits in a workspace; `ledger_counts` in the report.
