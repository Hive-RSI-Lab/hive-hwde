"""check_thermal.py - dissipation vs copper heatsink area (SPEC 6.3, P8).

One concern: a regulator / FET that dumps more heat than its copper can shed.
For each dissipating part named in constraints.json, estimate the junction-to-
ambient rise from the heatsink-net copper area and compare to the allowed rise.

Model (calibrated to datasheet anchors 2026-07; PROGRESS S5). theta_JA falls
off exponentially with copper pour area toward a floor:
    theta_JA(A) = theta_floor + (theta_0 - theta_floor) * exp(-A / tau)
    1 oz / 2-layer : theta_0=174, theta_floor=55, tau=350 mm^2
    2 oz / 4-layer : theta_0=140, theta_floor=45, tau=235 mm^2   (planes spread)
Rise ~= power_w * theta_JA(effective_area); a copper pour saturates near
~1 in^2 (645 mm^2), so past A_sat more copper barely helps - the fix there is
thermal vias to an inner/back plane, which the check flags separately. Every
number is +/-30%; this is a screen, not a sign-off (JEDEC JESD51 / TI SLOA122).

2-layer boards: the area curve alone floors at theta(A_SAT) ~74 C/W however
the layout is built, so a part with a thermal-via array into a back pour
(TI SLMA002 PowerPAD practice) could never meet a tight budget. The 2-layer
estimate is therefore the better of the area screen and a two-path network:
    top path : theta_top = theta_JA(A_top)  - the pour connected to the part's
               pads on its own side, through the same calibrated curve
    via path : R_vias + theta_JA(A_bot)     - the thermal vias / plated pad
               drills of the net under the part in parallel, into the back
               pour they land in, through the same curve again
    theta_2L = min(theta_JA(A_top + A_bot),  1 / (1/theta_top + 1/via_path))
One via conducts along its plated barrel only: R = t_board / (k_Cu * A_barrel),
A_barrel = pi*((d/2 + t_p)^2 - (d/2)^2), k_Cu = 380 W/m-K, t_p = 18 um (under
IPC-6012 class 2's 20 um average), unfilled (solder wicking ignored) - e.g.
~230 C/W for a 0.3 mm drill in 1.6 mm FR4; FR4 between vias is ignored. The
array is capped at VIA_BENEFIT_CAP. Conservative on purpose: re-using the
whole curve (package and convection included) on each path, and ignoring
solder fill and FR4 conduction, overstates theta. Example: 16 x 0.3 mm vias,
~120 mm2 connected top + ~640 mm2 bottom pour -> ~54 C/W (TPA3118D2 HTSSOP),
against TI's 22 C/W measured on its 2-layer EVM (SLOS708G 6.4). A bare pad with no vias gets the
area screen unchanged. 4-layer boards keep the area screen (it already sums
the inner planes). Thermal vias and copper weight on 4 layers are NOT
credited: the barrel network above needs a back pour that convects through
its own calibrated curve, and an inner plane has no such curve - re-running
MODEL_ML on each plane would count the planes twice, since that curve already
includes them. The one cited 4-layer via anchor found (TI SCBA017D Fig. 15:
a QFN's theta_JA falls 46.8 -> 29.9 C/W from JESD51-7 to JESD51-5, i.e. with
vias into the planes) is for a 2 mm logic pad and has not been checked
against a power package, so it is not applied here.

The via path needs a back pour to land in: when the back-side copper of the
net that those vias touch is smaller than the part's own pad hull (the vias
end on their own lands, or on a trace stub), the path is dropped and the part
gets the top pour alone. The threshold is a judgement, not a cited figure:
SLMA002 lands its 2-layer via arrays in a bottom-side copper area, and the
curve's theta_JA(0) = 174 C/W stands for a package on its pads, not for a
few via rings, so crediting that would be optimistic.

When a 2-layer part still fails, the error compares the budget against the
screen's best 2-layer case: VIA_BENEFIT_CAP vias (0.3 mm, SLMA002's drill, or
the largest drill found) into saturated pours on both sides, ~38 C/W on
1.6 mm FR4. A part over budget even there gets "cut the dissipation, add a
heatsink, or move to 4 layers" instead of "add thermal vias", because more
vias can't fix it within this model.

A part rated by its own datasheet for self-heating (an inductor's "Irms:
current for a 40 C rise", typically) is judged on that rating, not on the
board copper: the area curve is an IC-package curve (theta_JA(0) = 140-174
C/W for a part on its pads), and it says nothing about a 10 mm wound body
that sheds its heat from its own surface. The rating gives the part's own
theta, rise_c / (current_a^2 * dcr_ohm), and the entry's power_w (copper AND
core loss) rides on it. DCR is the 25 C value; at the rated rise the copper
is ~16 % more resistive, so the real rating-point loss is higher and this
theta errs high (conservative). Example: Coilcraft XAL1010-222, 2.8 mOhm,
24.5 A for 40 C -> 23.8 C/W, so 1.1 W -> 26 C (the area curve said 58 C/W).

A part may instead carry its datasheet theta_JA (theta_ja_c_w, with a
required theta_source naming the datasheet and its table/page). That figure
is measured on a JEDEC 2s2p board (JESD51-7: 76 x 114 mm, two solid inner
planes, the part alone dissipating), so it is used AS-IS: it replaces the
copper-area curve and the 2-layer via network, and is never combined with
area or via credit. It is optimistic on a crowded board whose other parts
heat the same copper, and on a layout without the vendor's thermal vias;
the via-count warning still runs against the copper floor for that reason.
A part takes a rating or a theta_ja_c_w, not both.

Forced air: an entry may declare the airflow over the part (airflow_lfm, or
airflow_m_s at 196.85 LFM per m/s; the board must say it has a fan). theta
is multiplied by the airflow factor, the LEAST improvement among TI's
modeled QFN tables (SCBA017D, Feb 2004, Tables 3-5, theta_JA C/W at 0 / 150
/ 250 / 500 LFM):
    20-pin JESD51-5  29.9 23.1 21.2 19.5     JESD51-7  46.8 40.5 38.2 36.0
    16-pin JESD51-5  31.2 24.4 22.5 20.7     JESD51-7  49.6 42.4 40.1 37.8
    14-pin JESD51-5  31.6 25.1 23.1 21.4     JESD51-7  52.5 46.0 42.9 40.5
The worst ratio at each speed is the 14-pin JESD51-7 row: x0.876 at 150,
x0.817 at 250, x0.771 at 500 LFM. Between points the factor is linear in
LFM (real convection gains are front-loaded, h ~ sqrt(v), so linear errs
high); past 500 LFM it stays at x0.771 (no extrapolation). The same factor
applies to a rated part and to a datasheet theta_JA (JEDEC publishes
forced-air theta_JA on the same 2s2p board). No airflow declared = factor 1.0 = still air,
exactly the model without it.

The corpus carries no thermal constraints, so this check is clean on all
goldens; supply parts via constraints.json to exercise it (a synthetic fixture
is tested).

Pad-up packages (a "top slug": TI's PowerPAD-up DDV/DAD/DKD/DKQ, e.g. the
TPA3221DDV and TPA3116D2DAD) put their exposed pad on TOP, for a heatsink.
The board reaches the die only through the leads (TPA3221: RthetaJB 14.9
C/W, SLASEE9C 6.4), so thermal vias can't drain it and no via array is asked
of it; more copper or vias barely move it. The check knows one by its Value,
LCSC number or MPN (SLUG_TOP_PARTS, SLUG_TOP_LCSC, or a TI TPA/TAS part
number ending in one of those package codes), or by the entry's
"slug": "top". Its board path is the datasheet's no-heatsink theta_JA
(theta_ja_c_w, or the table's figure): without one the entry is an error,
since the copper curve assumes a pad soldered down. A pad-up part on the
board with no thermal entry is a warning: nothing says how its slug is
cooled.

A heatsink (entry "heatsink", any package) is a second path in parallel
with the board path:
    R_hs   = theta_jc (slug side) + interface + spreading + theta_sa
    theta  = 1 / (1/theta_board + 1/R_hs)
theta_jc is the table's RthetaJC(top) for a known pad-up part, else
required. The interface is interface_c_w, or interface_mm / interface_k_w_mk
over contact_mm2 (the slug's area: the table's, else required): a 0.25 mm,
1 W/mK adhesive tape over the TPA3221's 29 mm2 slug is 8.6 C/W, a clamped
0.1 mm 3 W/mK pad 1.1 C/W, which is why the tape alone fails it. theta_sa
(the heatsink's own, in the airflow it will see) needs a source. The
heatsink has to exist and be held: "part" (what to buy) or "ref" (its
footprint on this board), and "hold": clip / screw / pushpin need the
board's provision for it in "mount_refs" (refdes of the holes or slots, on
the board); adhesive and lid need nothing on the board.

theta_ja_c_w is a datasheet's no-heatsink JEDEC figure, so a figure that
already assumes a heatsink is the gate passing a part on copper it doesn't
have. It is an error when: the part is a known one and the figure is under
90 % of the table's no-heatsink theta_JA (the table's figure is then used);
the figure is under 10 C/W with no heatsink declared (no SMD package gets
there on a JEDEC board alone; a judgement, not a cited figure); or its
theta_source speaks of a heatsink that the entry doesn't declare.

The box (constraints "enclosure") sets the air the parts sit in. Its heat
is every thermal entry's power_w plus other_w; it leaves through the walls
and through a vent path by the stack effect:
    G_walls = A_walls / (1/h_in + t_wall/k_wall + 1/h_out),
              h_in 5, h_out 10 W/m2K (still air; outside includes radiation)
    Q       = Cd * A_vent * sqrt(2 g H dT / T),  Cd 0.6 (sharp orifice)
    P       = G_walls * dT + rho * cp * Q(dT) * dT    solved for dT
A_walls is the box's outer surface less its floor ("floor": "feet", the
default, counts half; "flat" none; "open" all). A_vent is the vent path's
inlet, riser and outlet areas in series (1/A^2 = sum 1/A_i^2): a floor vent
under a board that fills the box only breathes through the edge gap, which
is the riser. H is stack_mm (default the box height). box_mm, or the
bounding box of the STL(s) in "stl", sizes the box. Air = room_c (default
30 C) + dT. Every part's junction is then air + rise, and an entry's
tj_max_c sets its allowed rise to tj_max_c - air (dt_c stays a rise over
whatever air there is). The plastic is checked against its glass
transition (PLASTIC_TG_C, or tg_c): air within 10 K of Tg is an error (the
box creeps under its screws), within 20 K a warning. Every term is +/-30 %:
a screen for the box, not a CFD run. Without an enclosure, ambient_c (top
level) is the air if given.

Governor: an entry's power_max_w is the part's continuous worst case (full
power into the lowest load). When that runs past the budget the part needs
a limit in firmware, named in "governor"; without one it is a warning. The
facts carry power_limit_w = allowed rise / theta, the number that limit
needs.

Bulk capacitors (constraints "ripple"): each entry's irms_a (operating
point) against its rating, rated_irms_a x freq_multiplier (the datasheet's
frequency factor at the switching frequency), with its source. Over the
rating is an error, over 75 % a warning (a judgement). irms_max_a (full
power) over the rating is a warning. With life_h at rated_c, life at the
box air is life_h x 2^((rated_c - T)/10) (electrolytic) or
10^((rated_c - T)/20) ("chem": "polymer"), where T = air + 5 K x
(irms_a / rating)^2 (a cap's core rise at its full rating is ~5 K, typical
of vendors' ripple ratings; a judgement); under life_min_h is a warning.
