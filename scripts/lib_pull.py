"""lib_pull.py - pull a part's KiCad symbol/footprint/3D via easyeda2kicad and
register it in the project library tables (SPEC.md P3, 6.1).

Wraps `easyeda2kicad --full --lcsc_id=Cxxxx --output <base>`, which writes
  <base>.kicad_sym            (symbol library)
  <base>.pretty/<fp>.kicad_mod (footprints, LEGACY (module ...) format)
  <base>.3dshapes/<name>.{wrl,step}
then appends the libraries to <project>/fp-lib-table + sym-lib-table (idempotent).
A part already in the library is left as it is (its footprint repairs stay)
unless --overwrite; only the 3D models its footprint names and <base>.3dshapes
lacks are fetched (easyeda2kicad --3d), which is how a fresh clone, whose
gitignored 3dshapes are gone, gets them back.
Footprints load in KiCad 10 despite the legacy format (LEARNINGS 2026-07-22
[easyeda2kicad]); --verify-load confirms it with `kicad-cli fp export svg`.

A raw pull is NOT fabricable as delivered, so four repairs run by default before
the pull is reported (all idempotent, all text surgery):
  model fit       EasyEDA's 3D model off its own footprint (the TYPE-C-31-M-12
                  USB-C 2.15 mm off and turned, the FPC-05F-20PH20 0.45 mm
                  off): each footprint's model is laid against its pads
                  (check_model_fit's fit: leads on the SMD pads, pins in the
                  holes, every slide within 5 mm at each quarter turn) and its
                  (offset)/(rotate) - and a (scale) not 1 1 1, or a model
                  floating off the board - rewritten to the fit, so render,
                  STEP and the enclosure fitted to it show the part where it
                  is. A model no slide or turn fits is left and listed in
                  model_fit.left                        -> --no-model-fit to skip
  fpfix           silk artifacts on pad copper, outlines under the silk-to-copper
                  bar, plated locating pegs (zero annular ring), legend text
                  hidden under the body, courtyards drawn inside their own pads
                  (EasyEDA's 0603s), an exposed pad's unnumbered thermal vias,
                  a placement type (attr) its pads contradict (EasyEDA's
                  XR0850 inductor: through_hole on two SMD pads)
                                             -> --no-autofix to skip
                  It also reads each part's 3D model and lists in
                  autofix.flags what it can't fix: a model off its footprint,
                  a peg with no hole, a body outside the courtyard.
  lib_refdes_norm every reference text sits at a blanket (0,-4.0) mm whatever the
                  part size                  -> --no-refdes-norm to skip
  lib_pin_types   every pin `unspecified`: the symbols this run pulled are
                  retyped (power_in on an IC's VCC/GND-named pins, else
                  passive; from parts/<lcsc>.json extracts beside --parts when
                  there are any)            -> --no-pin-types to skip
Every footprint's (model ...) path is then rewritten from the absolute path
easyeda2kicad writes to ${KIPRJMOD}/../lib/<lib>.3dshapes/<name> (relative to
--project, else <out_dir>/../kicad - for an out dir named lib/ even before
that kicad/ exists, the usual order of a new board), so the board survives
its checkout moving.
`--verify-drc` measures the result the only way that counts: one instance of each
pulled footprint alone on a scratch board, real DRC (LEARNINGS 2026-07-28
[easyeda2kicad][drc] - geometry checkers and DRC disagree).

Per-part success is judged from the SYMBOL LIBRARY, the only ground truth
(LEARNINGS 2026-07-28 [easyeda2kicad][parts]): a part is present iff
aiee.kicad_sym holds a top-level (symbol ...) block carrying
(property "LCSC Part" "<id>") whose Footprint property resolves to a file in
aiee.pretty. Footprints are SHARED (one C0603 served 5 parts) and record only
the first puller's id, so footprint grep is NOT a per-part signal.

A run keeps to a time budget (--budget-s, default 7 min): an EasyEDA call
that would overrun it isn't started, the rest come back `deferred` with
status `partial` (exit 1), and the fix-ups below still run on what was
pulled. Re-running the same command resumes: parts already in the library
aren't fetched again. Every easyeda2kicad call has a timeout (90 s, or
HWDE_EASYEDA_TIMEOUT_S, cut to what is left of the budget) that kills its
whole process group, so a stalled EasyEDA request can't hang the run: that
part comes back `deferred` (`stalled`) and the batch goes on. Each call
prints one progress line on stderr.

`--parts parts/parts.json` pulls every part in ONE paced batch: parts are
spaced --pace-s apart (auto: 0 for <=10 parts, 15 s for more - EasyEDA's
CloudFront WAF tripped at 4/35s after ~13 parts while 1/15s ran 31 clean), a
403/Forbidden failure backs off 90 s and retries once, and duplicate symbol
blocks (easyeda2kicad re-appends any name with a space or '/') are de-duped
after the batch.

Contract (SPEC section 6): argparse, JSON to stdout or --out, exit 0/1/2.
  0 = every requested part pulled (or already present)
  1 = one or more parts failed to pull, or were deferred (re-run to resume)
  2 = internal error / bad arguments

Examples:
  lib_pull.py --lcsc C1525
  lib_pull.py --parts parts/parts.json --project board/kicad --verify-load
  lib_pull.py --lcsc C8734 C25804 --out-dir board/lib --project board/kicad --verify-load
