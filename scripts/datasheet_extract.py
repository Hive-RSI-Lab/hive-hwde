"""datasheet_extract.py - datasheet PDF -> schema-validated part JSON (SPEC.md P3, 6.1).

The actual field extraction is LLM-assisted (a datasheet-extractor sub-agent
reads the PDF pages); this script owns the deterministic half:

  --pdf FILE        pull machine-readable text per page (pypdf) and emit a
                    grounding payload {text_by_page, schema, template} for the
                    agent to fill. Refuses non-PDF bytes (exit 2): the
                    www.lcsc.com datasheet URLs serve an HTML viewer shell and
                    an HTML "pinout" must never reach the extractor. Pages with
                    no schema-relevant keywords are emitted as stubs
                    {page, first_line, chars} to keep the grounding payload
                    proportional to schema needs, not datasheet length
                    (--full-text restores them). Image-only datasheets yield
                    little/no text - the agent then reads the rendered pages
                    directly.
  --fetch WS        download each WS/parts/parts.json line's datasheet to
                    WS/parts/datasheets/<lcsc>.pdf (or only --lcsc's) and
                    index them in WS/parts/datasheets/index.json. Every hop
                    must be on the research allowlist; LCSC's HTML redirect
                    stubs (wmsc.lcsc.com answers one) are followed, and
                    anything that isn't a PDF in the end is refused, never
                    written. index.json records pages, text chars per page
                    and status ok|suspect (+ reasons): suspect = the file is
                    cut off, has no text layer, or nothing ties it to the MPN
                    (#706, #755: see assess_pdf); a suspect PDF is kept but
                    check_ratings and the ledger never count it verified.
                    exit 0 = every datasheet fetched, 1 = some suspect,
                    refused or missing, 2 = bad workspace.
  --assess WS       re-read every index.json entry's PDF on disk (or only
                    --lcsc's) and write its status, with no download. An entry
                    with no status and no PDF becomes status unassessed. Not
                    needed in the ordinary way: check_ratings and the ledger
                    judge the PDFs on disk whenever they read the index, and
                    judge again only if the PDF, the MPN or ASSESS_VERSION
                    changed (#768); this forces it. exit 0 = all ok,
                    1 = some suspect or unassessed, 2 = no index.
  --render DIR      with --pdf: render the image-only pages (under
                    IMAGE_ONLY_CHARS of text) and the mechanical-drawing
                    pages to DIR/page-NNN.png with pdftoppm, OCR the
                    image-only ones with tesseract when it is on PATH (their
                    text then fills text_by_page, marked "ocr"), and list
                    them under "rendered" for the agent to read - a
                    connector drawing's pin and post sizes and its PCB-edge
                    line go into the extraction's `mechanical` block.
  --validate FILE   validate a candidate extraction against the schema.
                    exit 0 = valid, 1 = schema violations, 2 = unreadable.
  --schema          print the JSON Schema (single source of truth).
  --app-note FILE   U4 variant: same PDF handling, but the grounding payload
                    carries the KNOWLEDGE RECORD schema + template
                    (lib/knowledgelib.py) and layout-rule keywords - the
                    extractor fills reference/knowledge/records/*.yaml (one
                    record per class-level rule, sources citing this PDF by
                    page), stores the PDF under reference/knowledge/sources/,
                    then lints with `knowledge.py --validate`.
  --screen WS       U9 P3 layout screen (lib/layoutimpl.py): per part in
                    WS/parts/parts.json, the layout implications computed from
                    its extraction - thermal-via capacity of the exposed pad,
                    wire-entry direction + the rotation per board edge,
                    courtyard area vs the board budget (--board-mm, else the
                    state's stated size), pad pitch vs the routing floor - and
                    the CONFLICTS with architecture/constraints.json
                    (thermal min_vias over capacity, an edge rot that points
                    a wire entry inward, courtyards over budget). Writes
                    WS/parts/layout_implications.json; exit 1 on a conflict.
  --implications FILE [FILE ...]
                    the same fields for candidate extractions (part-sourcer),
                    ranked by layoutimpl.score against --needs JSON
                    {min_thermal_vias, edge, max_courtyard_mm2,
                    min_stub_width_mm}; exit 0.

The extracted JSON is the ground truth the schematic agents wire against
(SPEC P4: "never wire from model memory of a pinout") and the land pattern
fp_verify.py checks footprints against.
