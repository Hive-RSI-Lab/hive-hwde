"""dfm_check.py - gerber-level DFM against jlc_capabilities.yaml (SPEC P9).

The INDEPENDENT second geometry path. Every other check in the pipeline reads
the .kicad_pcb through geom.py; this one reads the files we actually ship - the
exported gerbers and Excellon drill, through gerbonara (lib/gerblib.py). Two
parsers over two formats means an export-stage defect shows up as a
disagreement instead of being invisible to a board-file-only checker.

Checks (all thresholds from reference/jlc_capabilities.yaml, keyed
<layers>layer_<oz>oz):

  copper   min_trace_width (pour copper too: a neck of a zone narrower
           than the floor over 2 floors or more, dfm_pour_width, #890),
           min_clearance (gap between distinct copper
           islands - gerbers carry no nets, so "touching = one conductor",
           which is exactly what the fab's own DFM engine sees),
           min_copper_to_edge. The checks measure the gerbers alone; each
           finding is then looked up in the board by its `ends` (name_gaps):
           `net` is its one net or both as "A | B", `refs` the parts at it,
           `on` what each end lies on, `same_net` a sliver of one net.
           A pair of islands gets one clearance finding per distinct pinch,
           and a piece of copper one edge finding per place it nears the edge,
           at most PINCH_CAP_PER_PAIR each, the tightest first
  drill    min_hole_diameter, min_hole_to_hole, min_hole_to_edge,
           annular ring (hole vs the pad copper around it). Castellated
           holes (pad_prop_castellated) are exempt from hole/copper-to-edge
           and the ring check - they sit on the edge by design - and are
           checked by the castellation family instead. Only the pad and the
           copper within the edge floor of it is exempt from copper-to-edge,
           not the rest of its piece
  castellation  lib/castellation.py over the BOARD file against the
           castellated: block of jlc_capabilities.yaml: drill, hole-to-hole,
           ring, inward pad extension, hole centre on the outline, distance
           to other edges and corners, board size and thickness, and a
           plated hole the outline cuts without the castellated property
  mask     silk_over_pad (silk ink inside a mask opening = unprintable/
           unsolderable), solder-mask dam between openings
  silk     min silk stroke width
  paste    paste aperture with NO mask opening (tented SMD pad - the stencil
           deposits paste on mask and the part cannot be soldered; a classic
           wrong-layer/footprint export defect)
  assembly CPL polarity: board pad->net vs schematic pin->net. KiCad's own
           --schematic-parity is net-level and does NOT catch a polarized part
           mounted backwards (LEARNINGS/V9); comparing per PAD NUMBER does, and
           the pad geometry gives the apparent rotation delta.
  placement CPL rotation per part vs its OWN LCSC footprint model
           (cpl_verify.py): pin 1 must land on pad 1 and a diode/LED/polar
           cap's cathode/+ on the board's, with the shipped CPL (fab dir's
           CPL.csv, else this run's). A wrong part, and a part with no model
           or no fit, is an ERROR (cpl_rotation / cpl_no_model); a model
           centre off the board's by > 0.5 mm is a warning (cpl_offset); over 0.4 x
           the pad pitch on a fine-pitch part (0.5 mm BGA: 0.2 mm) an ERROR. Parts
           on the bottom are fitted mirrored and read from below; the rule is
           the community exporters' plus the geometry, not JLC's, so any bottom
           part that passes also raises one warning for the run,
           cpl_bottom_preview: confirm them in JLC's order preview
           (reference/jlc_bottom_cpl.md). A part right either way round (an
           unpolarised two-pad part) is right under both readings and raises
           none. An unpolarised, unkeyed two-pad part with no model is checked
           against the shape every LCSC two-pad model has (pads along x,
           centred): turned across its pads or off them it fails as above,
           either way along them it passes. A ball grid with no model is checked
           against its footprint's own A1 corner: a turned CPL row is an ERROR
           (cpl_rotation), and a match raises one warning for the run,
           cpl_footprint_basis, because it rests on a convention JLC doesn't
           publish, so confirm it in the preview (reference/jlc_bga_cpl.md).
           JLC places by the silkscreen when it disagrees with the CPL, so on
           ball grids and U/IC parts a pin-1 dot or chamfer off pin 1's corner
           is an ERROR (cpl_silk_mark), and no mark at all raises one warning
           for the run (cpl_no_silk_mark), since JLC emails to confirm.
           A model fetch that FAILED (EasyEDA 403/429 rate limit, other HTTP
           status, network) is one finding for the run, cpl_fetch_failed,
           listing the parts and the reason - never cpl_no_model. When it is
           the run's only error the run is UNVERIFIED, not failed: status
           error, exit 2, `unverified` naming the parts; rerun once EasyEDA
           answers. Models are cached in the board (<parts.json dir>/easyeda,
           env.easyeda_cache) as they are fetched - commit that dir and the
           board's dfm never asks EasyEDA again.
           Runs with --parts. The fab step's image pass (cpl_render.py + a
           vision agent -> cpl_visual.json beside the CPL, or --visual) sits
           beside it: a part the two disagree on, or one the image pass left
           out, is an ERROR (cpl_visual_disagree); no image pass at all is a
           coverage hole (family placement_visual) that --strict refuses.
           A CPL with rows on both sides at JLC only goes as Standard PCBA:
           under its rails, fiducials or 70 x 70 mm is a warning
           (both_sides_needs_panel, castellated_needs_panel for a castellated
           board). A panel counts: panel.json in <CPL dir>/panel/ or beside the
           CPL, or a board file that has them itself.
  zone_fill  the BOARD's saved zone fills against a fresh refill: a board
           saved without a refill passes DRC (it checks the netclass floor,
           not the zone's rule) and the Gerbers carry the stale copper
           (FAB-27, hwde-led-test DFM-1: 0.1275 mm vs 0.5 mm).
           A gap under the zone's clearance is only a candidate (a project
           rule can set a smaller one): it is confirmed on a refilled copy
           (kicad-cli, ~10 s, only when there are candidates), stale where
           the fresh fill sits further from the item. NPTH holes are left
           out (KiCad clears them by hole clearance). ERROR
           (dfm_stale_zone_fill); refill before export. No refill possible
           = a coverage hole (zone_fill skipped), never a pass
  netlist  Valor/CAM350 netlist compare, what a fab's E-test does: the
           shipped copper's islands, joined through plated holes and slots
           (blind/buried by their drill file's span), against the IPC-D-356
           netlist (the package's `<name>.ipc`, else kicad-cli's from the
           board; lib/ipcd356.py). One island holding two nets = ERROR
           dfm_net_short (net ties exempt); one net in two islands, or a
           test point on no copper = ERROR dfm_net_open; a D-356 name that
           stands for two board nets (kicad-cli truncates to 14 chars) =
           WARNING dfm_netlist_name_clash
  release  gerber layer completeness (against the BOARD's declared layer set,
           never the files being audited - a package that dropped a layer must
           read as incomplete, not as a smaller board), drill validity,
           closed Edge.Cuts outline, and the ASSEMBLY-CLASS legs: an
           `smt_placed`/`tht` part with no LCSC number, a part classed
           `smt_placed`/`tht` with no placement, a declared populate quantity the classes
           contradict, and a shipped BOM/CPL that lists a part the declared
           variant does not place (codex C9 - rf-de-20m's nine DNP sites)

The capability key (<layers>layer_<oz>oz) is derived from the BOARD: layer
count from its (layers ...) block, copper weight from its (stackup ...) block
(0.035 mm = 1 oz), unless --copper-oz pins it explicitly. With no stackup
thickness, or a weight the capability table has no rules for (kept as the
copper_oz_stackup fact), the 1 oz floors are used and not_judged says which.

Severity policy: a JLCPCB manufacturing minimum that is actually violated is an
ERROR. Where the row carries JLC's absolute floor apart from the value a design
is held to (abs_min_<key> vs min_<key>, #554: via drill/diameter/ring, hole
size, copper to edge, pad and via hole-to-hole), only a value under the
absolute floor is an error; one between the two is ONE warning per kind
(`<kind>_preferred`, listing every place), and a via size JLC builds for
more money is a warning `dfm_via_cost_tier` per size, naming the tier
(`via` family: board vias against min_via_drill/min_via_diameter). Advisory classes that legitimate boards routinely trip - silk stroke
width (KiCad's default 0.12 mm silk prints fine at JLC) and mask dams - are
WARNINGS, so they are reported without failing the gate (the fp_verify /
netlist_audit precedent).

Emits the S2 normalized violation schema via checklib; exit 0/1/2.
