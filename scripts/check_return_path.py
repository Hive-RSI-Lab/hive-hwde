"""check_return_path.py - return-path continuity for high-speed nets (SPEC 6.3).

Per net in constraints.json["high_speed"]:
 1. Signal track segments per layer; each layer's reference layer(s) come from
    the stackup (adjacent copper: microstrip = one, stripline = two).
 2. Reference copper on a reference layer = the reference net's copper there.
    The spec names the filled-zone polygons; this check unions ALL reference-net
    copper (fill + tracks + pads + vias) and then keeps only the single
    connected component under the corridor, so "continuous reference copper"
    is honored while same-net stitching copper does not false-positive.
    The reference NET is RESOLVED per (signal layer, reference layer): when the
    declared net has no zone fill under the corridor but another net does (an
    F/GND/PWR/B stack puts a power plane under every B.Cu trace), the corridor
    is judged against that net's copper in cross-net waiver mode - real plane
    splits still surface, but as "warning" with waiver_class
    "cross_net_reference", never "error" (LEARNINGS 2026-07-30: the declared
    net's via-disk copper otherwise fails every such trace by construction).
 3. Corridor = trace centerline buffered by k x trace_width (k default 3,
    ~return-current spread), flat-capped: the corridor ends where the trace
    ends (a round cap would poke past the landing pad into copper the signal
    never runs over). Violation where the corridor is not contained in that
    continuous reference copper (plane voids, zone gaps, other-net copper all
    surface as corridor deficit).
 4. At every layer transition (signal via joining tracks on two layers): if the
    reference plane changes layer or net, require a same-reference-net via
    (or, for different reference nets, a stitching capacitor) within radius
    r = c / (f_knee * 20) from t_rise, default 2.0 mm.
 5. Output: normalized violations with polygons + coordinates + layer;
    severity by centerline crossing length.
 6. Hatched reference copper counts as copper (#870): a zone filled as a
    hatch is one polygon with a field of small, similar holes; the holes no
    bigger than HATCH_HOLE_FACTOR x the median one, and no wider than
    HATCH_MAX_GAP_MM, are filled back in, so the hatch reads as the plane it
    is. A real cut-out in the hatch is bigger than its cells and stays a
    void. The resolution record marks such a layer "hatched".
 7. Rigid-flex (#870): a FLEX_* rule area that keeps copper pours out of a
    layer says that layer is not in the flex stackup there, so the corridor
    is not judged against that layer inside the area (a trace on In1 in a
    tail with no F.Cu is referenced to In2 alone), nor in the
    FLEX_PULLBACK_MM band the rigid copper leaves at the rigid-flex line.
    Other keepouts (an antenna's) are still voids: only the flex areas
    remove a layer.

Unavoidable single-item plane punctures are EXCISED from the deficit before
judging it: the annular clearance void around any single via (the signal's
own transition via, and lone other-net vias whose antipad merely nicks the
corridor), and the clearance/thermal ring around the signal's or reference
net's own through pads (thermal spokes carry the return current; the ring is
not a break). Excision removes at most a disk of item radius + one zone
clearance around each such item, so structural voids - slots, moats, merged
antipad chains away from single vias - always survive with their remainder,
and severity is judged on what remains. A through-pad FIELD of another net
(connector row) is deliberately not excised.
