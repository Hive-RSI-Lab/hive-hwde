# hive-pcb-flow

The pcb-flow module: KiCad hardware design for the Hive, in the Hive org like the other modules. It began as ihsan-sa/pcb-flow's Claude Code skill and is its own now ([where it came from](docs/upstream.md)).

An agent designs a PCB from a written brief: research, architecture, parts, schematic, placement, routing, then the checks (ERC, DRC, the verify suite, JLCPCB DFM on the exported Gerbers), ending in a fab package. The person signs off between stages. Ordering and paying are always the person's.

**Where to file issues:** https://github.com/Hive-RSI-Lab/hive-hwde/issues, for a bug or for something that doesn't work on your machine (an Arm computer, another OS): say what you ran and what you saw. An agent in a Hive can draft the issue for you with `hive-report upstream draft`; you read it and press Send.

- [`docs/README.md`](docs/README.md): how an agent uses it in the Hive; [`docs/playbook.md`](docs/playbook.md): the phases, gates and fix loop
- `agents/`: the role prompts the playbook spawns; `scripts/`: the checks and tools; `reference/`: their tables, recipes, checklists and knowledge records
- `tests/`: unit tests for the scripts (`test_env_lookups.py`: the lookups for the Hive's shared tools folder), and `tests/workarounds/`, the probes
- `bin/pcb-flow`: runs the scripts in a Hive sandbox with the Hive's KiCad 10 and freerouting (`pcb-flow check` first)
- The first board made with it: [boards/hwde-led-test/](boards/hwde-led-test/)
- [docs/errata-corpus.md](docs/errata-corpus.md): public boards whose rev B fixed a rev A defect, and which of those defects pcb-flow's checks catch on rev A (`bin/pcb-flow errata_corpus fetch|run|table`)
- [docs/research/](docs/research/README.md): current research turned into checks: `bin/pcb-flow papers` scans the topics in `reference/research/watch.yaml`, reads legitimate open copies (the rest go on [the person's list](docs/research/paywalled.md)), and gives each claim pcb-flow's own verdict, with the test that reached it; only reproduced claims become [guidelines](docs/research/guidelines.md)
- [docs/route-quality.md](docs/route-quality.md): a layout judged as good, not only legal: `route_quality` scores each net class against its shortest 45-degree routes, `route_improve` re-routes the worst nets in rounds and stops when a round stops gaining

## Test and score

- **Test**, `bin/pcb-flow test`, run on every change: upstream's unit tests
  for the skill's scripts (in `tests/`, from ihsan-sa/pcb-flow, about 2,400 of
  them) and the workaround probes. It leaves out tests marked `smoke` (a
  live KiCad run) or `net` (the internet), and points `HWDE_BOARDS_ROOT` at
  an empty dir, so tests that want a real board skip. Upstream tests that
  fail here for a cause a brief already owns are expected failures, listed
  with that brief in `tests/conftest.py`; one that starts passing shows as
  XPASS, and its line comes out. `tests/test_workarounds.py` runs every
  probe in `tests/workarounds/` and fails when
  [docs/workarounds.md](docs/workarounds.md) doesn't match them: a cause
  that stands with no row, or a row whose cause is fixed. It also leaves
  out the tests listed as `slow` in `tests/conftest.py` (`SLOW`: the live
  toolchain, whole fixture boards through bench or the gates, intake of a
  whole project); `bin/pcb-flow test-slow` runs those, so run it too on a change
  to the checks, bench, intake or `check_env`. `bin/pcb-flow test-em` runs the long
  full-wave solves test-slow leaves out (`EM` in `tests/conftest.py`, 80 min
  against test-slow's 17 on a machine at load 45), so run it on a change to `scripts/lib/em*`
  or `scripts/lib/solvers.py`. A test past its limit (15 min, 45 in `em`) fails
  by name. `bin/pcb-flow test-smoke` runs the
  `smoke` tests, whole flows on a live KiCad; CI runs them on every PR and
  daily (`.github/workflows/smoke.yml`), and a failed daily run opens an issue. The test keeps its scratch
  files on `/dev/shm` when it has room and nothing in it fsyncs
  (`HWDE_NO_FSYNC`), because on a loaded disk the suite's file writes, not
  its CPU, set its time; it prints its time and its slowest 15 tests at
  the end. A few minutes; pytest arguments pass through
  (`bin/pcb-flow test tests/test_fab.py -x`).
- **Boards**, `bin/pcb-flow check-all`, not the per-change test: copies every
  board under `boards/` to a scratch dir and re-runs its gate steps there
  through `bin/pcb-flow`: `erc`, `drc_routed`, `verify`, `fab` (gerbers, drill,
  BOM and CPL from `fab_export` and `bom_cpl`) and `dfm`. A board runs each
  gate its `state.json` records as passed, and `fab` once it has a package
  in `fab/`. Any step that fails fails it, and it runs the probes too. Its
  time grows with every board, so run it on a change to the gates, the
  shims in `bin/pcb-flow` or a board, and before a release. Both need
  `/hive/tools`'s KiCad and the Hive's uv; on a fresh HOME they build the
  venv first. Inside a Hive turn both, and the scripts that run a whole
  board, the router or a sim (`route_auto`, `route_critical`,
  `place_anneal`, `gate`, `verify_all`, `bench`, `render`, `sim_run`,
  `sim_solve`, `fab_export`), run under `hive agent heavy`: they wait (at most 10
  minutes) while the machine is strained and other turns run one. A command
  already inside one (check-all's gates, a test that runs `bin/pcb-flow`), or a
  Hive without that op yet, runs bare (`tests/test_heavy.py`).
- **Score**, `bin/pcb-flow score`, higher is better: what this checkout's
  gates get wrong on boards held fixed. The hi-fi receiver's lite-main, core and ultra-front,
  pinned in `pinned/` at one hifi-receiver-2 commit, and hwde-led-test go
  through erc, drc_routed, verify and dfm with `bin/pcb-flow`'s shims off. Each board's
  ledger (`pinned/known/<board>.json`) judges its findings: one held real
  is the board's defect and costs nothing; one held false, one not judged
  yet, a known real one no gate reports any more, and each board-local
  script that stands in for pcb-flow is a charge, and the score is minus the
  charges. A fix in pcb-flow that clears a false finding on those boards raises
  it with nothing written by hand; a sharper check's new real findings go
  into the ledger in the same change. A pinned board changes only through `bin/pcb-flow pin`. The whole
  definition is [docs/score.md](docs/score.md). About ten minutes or more,
  under `hive agent heavy`. A looser check finds less, so the score also
  runs pcb-flow's planted faults (`bin/strength.py`: the gate criteria, every
  verify check's mutant in `tests/golden/`, dfm at JLC's floors), and each
  one a check lets through charges 100.

MIT, like upstream; see NOTICE for what that doesn't cover.
