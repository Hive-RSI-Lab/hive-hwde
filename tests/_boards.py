"""Real board workspaces for the few tests that need one.

Boards left hwde for their own repo (env.boards_root(): HWDE_BOARDS_ROOT,
default ~/dev/boards), so hwde's suite never depends on them. A test that
really needs a shipped board asks for it here: it runs against the boards
repo when that is cloned, and SKIPS with the reason when it is not - never a
silent pass, never a failure on a box without the boards repo. Anything a
small fixture under tests/ can stand in for uses the fixture instead.
